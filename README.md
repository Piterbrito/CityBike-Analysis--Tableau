# CityBike-Analysis--Tableau

# Background

As Lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
 
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

* Female ridership has increased year over year but male ridership still far outpaces all genders


How does the average trip duration change by age?

* In 2016 the average ages for trip durations was relatively steady, meaning that across all ages trip durations were quite similar
* In 2017 there are stark noticable differences in that 32, 21 and 24 year olds comprised the top 3 ages for longest trip durations
* In 2018 the top 3 ages shift to 50, 18 and 42 year olds with the longest trip durations


What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
